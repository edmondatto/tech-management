## Blogs
> The best place to start on this section is probably the most popular posts, with an eye towards whatever topics are of particular interest to you.  There's a lot on management and leadership here, but also on more technical topics, particularly from the company blogs.

1. Rands in Repose
    1. [Don't Skip This](http://randsinrepose.com/dont-skip-this/)
    1. [Management cheat sheet](http://randsinrepose.com/archives/management-cheat-sheet/)

## Books
> Not in any particular order, i.e. first != important.  WIP, decidedly not comprehensive.

#### General Management/Leadership
1. **High Output Management –– Andrew Grove**\
Ben Horowitz kept swearing by this book, so I finally decided to read it.  A quick read, and way more detailed, practical advice than I would have expected.  This is probably the best place to start.

1. **Difficult Conversations –– Sheila Heen, Douglas Stone, Bruce Patton**\
This was probably the most common suggestion for what to give new managers from my CTO group.  Worth a reread for me.  After delegating, having tough conversations and giving effective feedback is one of the things new managers struggle with most.

1. **How Will You Measure Your Life –– Clayton Christensen, James Allworth, Karen Dillon**\
Most of this isn't about management, but there was one section that really resonated for me. He describes the "craft of management" as a noble pursuit, at its core a service to others, especially when you consider how important good management is to people's lives and futures. Good reminder to see management as an honor, not a burden (hard to remember at times).

1. **One Minute Manager –– Ken Blanchard, Spencer Johnson**\
Literally the first book on management I ever read when my first boss, also a first-time manager, gave it to me.  A bit hokey, but on the plus side, really short!

#### Software Engineering
1. **Joel on Software –– Joel Spolsky**\
Lots of good nuggets in here, mostly just a collection of his blog posts.

1. **Mythical Man Month –– Fred Brooks**\
Still completely relevant.

1. **Pragmatic Programmer –– Andy Hunt, Dave Thomas**\
This is good for ICs too.  I think the former CTO @ Medium said he gets a copy for every new hire.

#### Social Emotional Learning / Understanding your own brain
1. **Thinking Fast and Slow –– Farrar, Straus and Giroux**\
Super engaging, though a bit long.  Fascinating topics, you learn all the various ways in which your brain tricks you by taking shortcuts.  Sometimes these shortcuts are useful.  Many times not.  Learn to identify them ahead of time.

1. **Quiet: Power of Introverts –– Susan Cain**\
Didn't love it, but still probably worth reading for people that are introverts and have fears about stepping into roles they think require more extroversion.

1. **Flourish –– Martin Seligman**\
One of the many recent books on happiness science.  Might be better ones out there.

#### Culture/Organization
1. **Delivering Happiness –– Tony Hsieh**\
Don't actually remember much from this. Not sure there was a ton of practical advice.

1. **[Netflix's Culture Presentation](https://www.slideshare.net/reed2001/culture-1798664/2-Netflix_CultureFreedom_Responsibility2)**\
Not a book.  Netflix's culture presentation.  Was really bold and unique when first published.  New wave of companies probably have even more to say.

## What Skills To Develop as a Manager
1. These Quora responses have decent descriptions of skills to develop for management:
    1. [What qualities and skills separate an Engineering Manager vs Director of Engineering vs VP of engineering?](https://www.quora.com/What-qualities-and-skills-separate-an-Engineering-Manager-vs-Director-of-Engineering-vs-VP-of-Engineering)
    1. [What are the primary traits of a great people manager?](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-primary-traits-of-a-great-people-manager)
1. This [series of posts](http://www.eliothorowitz.com/blog/2013/10/17/debugging-the-boss-intro/) has a bunch of anti-patterns for leadership and how to not fall into them.
1. This [online class](https://www.coursera.org/learn/motivate-people-teams/) will help you learn how to create a shared vision for your team and effectively communicate it to your teammates.

## Transitioning From IC to Leader
1. A great set of posts from First Round Capital blog.  Here are a couple, but it's worth looking for more.
    1. [This 90-day plan turns engineers into remarkable managers](http://firstround.com/review/this-90-day-plan-turns-engineers-into-remarkable-managers/)
    1. [The most dangerous leadership traps and the 15 minute daily practice that will save you](http://firstround.com/review/the-most-dangerous-leadership-traps-and-the-15-minute-daily-practice-that-will-save-you/)
    1. [The keys to scaling yourself as a technology leader](http://firstround.com/review/the-keys-to-scaling-yourself-as-a-technology-leader/)
1. Some other good posts (and more good posts linked to from these)
    1. [Notes on Startup Engineering Management](https://www.elidedbranches.com/2015/10/notes-on-startup-engineering-management.html?m=1)

    1. [Lead Developer to CTO at a Startup](https://www.socalcto.com/2012/07/lead-developer-to-cto-at-startup.html)
    
#### Should I Still Code?
This is one view.  I think keeping your hands somewhat dirty is important, but that doesn't necessarily require writing code yourself.
1. [Engineering Managers Should Code 30% of Their Time](https://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/engineering-managers-should-code-30-of-t/240165174)

## Engineering Career Paths and Leveling
1. This is a rather good template and description of skills required at each level (for ICs and managers) from Rent the Runway:
    1. [Engineering Ladder](https://dresscode.renttherunway.com/blog/ladder)
    1. [Ladder Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k4sO6pyCl_YYnf0PAXSBcX776rNcTjSOqDxZ5SDty-4/edit#gid=0)
1. A great [description](http://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/10/25/on-being-a-senior-engineer/) of what it means to be a "senior engineer".

## Estimation/Planning
[Evidence-based scheduling](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2007/10/26.html) by Joel Spolsky.  Might be a bit overkill, but you can get a lot of the same things out of Jira.
