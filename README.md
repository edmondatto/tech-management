## Books
> Not in any particular order, i.e. first != important.  WIP, decidedly not comprehensive.

#### General Management/Leadership
1. **High Output Management –– Andrew Grove**\
Ben Horowitz kept swearing by this book, so I finally decided to read it.  A quick read, and way more detailed, practical advice than I would have expected.  This is probably the best place to start.

1. **Difficult Conversations –– Sheila Heen, Douglas Stone, Bruce Patton**\
This was probably the most common suggestion for what to give new managers from my CTO group.  Worth a reread for me.  After delegating, having tough conversations and giving effective feedback is one of the things new managers struggle with most.

1. **How Will You Measure Your Life –– Clayton Christensen, James Allworth, Karen Dillon**\
Most of this isn't about management, but there was one section that really resonated for me. He describes the "craft of management" as a noble pursuit, at its core a service to others, especially when you consider how important good management is to people's lives and futures. Good reminder to see management as an honor, not a burden (hard to remember at times).

1. **One Minute Manager –– Ken Blanchard, Spencer Johnson**\
Literally the first book on management I ever read when my first boss, also a first-time manager, gave it to me.  A bit hokey, but on the plus side, really short!

#### Software Engineering
1. **Joel on Software –– Joel Spolsky**\
Lots of good nuggets in here, mostly just a collection of his blog posts.

1. **Mythical Man Month –– Fred Brooks**\
Still completely relevant.

1. **Pragmatic Programmer –– Andy Hunt, Dave Thomas**\
This is good for ICs too.  I think the former CTO @ Medium said he gets a copy for every new hire.

#### Social Emotional Learning / Understanding your own brain
1. **Thinking Fast and Slow –– Farrar, Straus and Giroux**\
Super engaging, though a bit long.  Fascinating topics, you learn all the various ways in which your brain tricks you by taking shortcuts.  Sometimes these shortcuts are useful.  Many times not.  Learn to identify them ahead of time.

1. **Quiet: Power of Introverts –– Susan Cain**\
Didn't love it, but still probably worth reading for people that are introverts and have fears about stepping into roles they think require more extroversion.

1. **Flourish –– Martin Seligman**\
One of the many recent books on happiness science.  Might be better ones out there.

#### Culture/Organization
1. **Delivering Happiness –– Tony Hsieh**\
Don't actually remember much from this. Not sure there was a ton of practical advice.

1. **[Netflix's Culture Presentation](https://www.slideshare.net/reed2001/culture-1798664/2-Netflix_CultureFreedom_Responsibility2)**\
Not a book.  Netflix's culture presentation.  Was really bold and unique when first published.  New wave of companies probably have even more to say.
